# one-game-a-month
This is our http://www.onegameamonth.com/ repository for games!

We started with gloomy-go and we enjoyed to develop it so much that we dropped #OneGameAMonth for now, while we finish gloomy.
This repository does not holds the version we are working now because it became a private project.

The production version is already shipped to google play, check it out!

Enjoy =)
